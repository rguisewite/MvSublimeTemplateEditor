# MvSublimeTemplateEditor
Sublime Text 3 Plugin for Miva Web Developers

This Sublime Text plugin allows Miva Web Developers to edit store pages/templates directly from Sublime.  Developers can pull up the list of pages/templates in a store, select one, and then edit it directly from Sublime.

Download the zip file. Extract the src/ directory, rename it to MvSublimeTemplateEditor, and copy it into one of the following directories:

Ubuntu: ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/

OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/

Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\

You must also add the compiled version (.mvc) of the sublime_templateeditor module into the host store (simply add it to the Modules screen) located in the bin/ directory
